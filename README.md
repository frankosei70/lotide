# Lotide

A mini clone of the [Lodash](https://lodash.com) library.

## Purpose

**_BEWARE:_ This library was published for learning purposes. It is _not_ intended for use in production-grade software.**

This project was created and published by me as part of my learnings at Lighthouse Labs. 

## Usage

**Install it:**

`npm install @oseiwusu/lotide`

**Require it:**

`const _ = require('@oseiwusu/lotide');`

**Call it:**

`const results = _.tail([1, 2, 3]) // => [2, 3]`

## Documentation

The following functions are currently implemented:
assertArraysEqual: Asserts whether two arrays are equal

* assertEqual: Asserts two primitive values are equal.

* asserObjectEqual: Asserts whether two objects are equal.

* countLetters: Returns an object where each unique character in a given string is a key and the value for that property should be the number of occurrences for that character.
* countOnly: Given an array and an object, it will return an object containing counts of everything that the input object listed.
* eqArrays: Compares the data of two arrays to check if they are equal to each other.
* eqObjects: Compares the data of two objects to check if they are equal to each other.
* findKey: Takes an object and a callback and return the first key for which the callback returns a truthy value. If no key is found, then it should return undefined.
* findKeyByValue: Takes an object and a value and returns the first key which contains the given value. If no key with that given value is found, it returns undefined.

* flatten: array containing other nested arrays, it flattens it into a single-level array.
* head: Returns the first item in the array.
* letterPositions: Returns an object containing each characters as keys and as values all the indices in the string where each character is found.
* map: Returns a new array based on the results of the callback function.
* middle: Returns an array with only the middle element(s) of the provided array, a single middle element for odd arrays and two middle elements for even arrays.
* tail: Returns the "tail" of an array.
* takeUntil: Returns a "slice of the array with elements taken from the beginning." It should keep going until the callback returns a truthy value.
* without: Takes an array and an itemsToRemove array. It should return a new array with only the elements from source that are not present in the itemsToRemove array.
